# There is an array of  integers. There are also  disjoint sets,  and , each containing  integers. You like all the integers in set  and dislike all the integers in set . Your initial happiness is . For each  integer in the array, if , you add  to your happiness. If , you add  to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

# Note: Since  and  are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.

# Input Format

# The first line contains integers  and  separated by a space.
# The second line contains  integers, the elements of the array.
# The third and fourth lines contain  integers,  and , respectively.

# Output Format

# Output a single integer, your total happiness.
